EXPERIMENT:myExperiment version:1.0

Variables:
Factors:    // Please, change the values, domain and add the factors of your experiemnt
    var1 enum "value1", "value2", "value3"
    var2 enum "value4", "value5"
Outcome:
   outcome in R  // You should change the name of the outcomen variable to

Hypothesis: Differential    // By default we assume a differential hypothesis, meaning
                            // that the value of var1 has a significant effect on the
                            // value of outome, i.e. it makes a difference.

Design:
 Sampling: Random   
 Groups: by var1 sizing 30
 Protocol: Random
 Analyses:                  // By default we provide two set of analyses:
    DescriptiveStatitics:   //   descriptive statistics about the results:
        StdDev(var1)
        StdDev(var1,var2)
        StdDev(Filter(var1).Grouping({var2}))
